Query Command Complete
======================

Vim plugin to suggest completions with the results of an external
query command.

The original intention is to use it as a mutt query_command wrapper
to complete addresses in the mail headers, but it can be adapted
to any other kind of functionality by modifying the exposed setting
parameters.

Setup:
  This plugin exports the completion function QueryCommandComplete,
  which can be set as the complete function (or omni function) for
  any filetype. If you have a working mutt setup with query_command
  configured, the plugin works out of the box.

  Example:
      let g:qcc_query_command='abook'
      au BufRead /tmp/mutt* setlocal omnifunc=QueryCommandComplete

Settings:
  Note: Overriding settings on a buffer-basis is supported. So
        b:qcc_query_command takes precedence over g:qcc_query_command

  g:qcc_query_command
      External command that queries for contacts
      If empty, QueryCommandComplete tries to guess what command to
      run by executing `mutt -Q query_command`.

  g:qcc_line_separator
      Separator for each entry in the result from the query
      default: '\n'

  g:qcc_field_separator
      Separator for the fields of an entry from the result
      default: '\t'

  g:qcc_pattern
      Pattern used to match against the current line to decide
      whether to call the query command
      default: '^\(To\|Cc\|Bcc\|From\|Reply-To\):'

  g:qcc_multiline
      Whether to try matching g:qcc_pattern against the current
      and any previous line
      default: 0

  g:qcc_multiline_pattern
      Pattern to match against the current line when deciding
      wether to keep looking for a line that matches g:qcc_pattern
      This provides finer control over the recursion, which
      is useful if calling the completion on really big files.
      default: '.*'

  g:qcc_format_word
      Format string to be used when building the word field
      of the completion (i.e.: the final result, what gets fed into
      the current line when you select an option)
      default: '${1} <${0}>' (as in: FirstName <email@domain.com>)

  g:qcc_format_abbr
      Format string to be used when building the abbreviation
      for the completion menu (i.e.: the first row in the completion
      menu).
      default: '${1}'

  g:qcc_format_menu
      Format string for the optional second column of the completion
      menu.
      default: '${2}'
