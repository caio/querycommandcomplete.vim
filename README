Query Command Complete
======================

Vim plugin to suggest completions with the results or an external
query command.

The original intention is to use it as a mutt query_command wrapper
to complete addresses in the mail headers, but it can be adapted
to any other kind of functionality by modifying the exposed setting
parameters.

      au BufRead /tmp/mutt* setlocal omnifunc=QueryCommandComplete

      default: '\n'

  g:qcc_field_separator
      Separator for the fields of an entry from the result
      default: '\t'

  g:qcc_pattern
