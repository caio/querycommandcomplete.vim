Query Command Complete
======================

Vim plugin to suggest completions with the results or an external
query command.

The original intention is to use it as a mutt query_command wrapper
to complete addresses in the mail headers, but it can be adapted
to any other kind of functionality by modifying the exposed setting
parameters.

Setup:
  This plugin exports the completion function QueryCommandComplete,
  which needs to be set as the complete function (or omni function)
  in order to work.

      au BufRead /tmp/mutt* setlocal omnifunc=QueryCommandComplete

  g:qcc_query_command
      External command that queries for contacts

  g:qcc_line_separator
      Separator for each entry in the result from the query
      default: '\n'

  g:qcc_field_separator
      Separator for the fields of an entry from the result
      default: '\t'

  g:qcc_pattern
      Pattern used to match against the current line to decide
      whether to call the query command
      default: '^\(To\|Cc\|Bcc\|From\|Reply-To\):'
